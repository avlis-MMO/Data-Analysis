# Weather Data Cleaning, Transformation, and Analysis

Welcome to the documentation for the **Weather Data Cleaning, Transformation, and Analysis** script. This Python script is designed to process weather data stored in a CSV file, previously obtained from a previous project. The script cleans and transforms the temperature data to Celsius, performs various analyses, and generates meaningful visualizations. The main purpose of the **Weather Data Cleaning, Transformation, and Analysis** script is to automate the data cleaning and analysis process for the previously obtained weather data. By processing the data, converting temperature units, and generating insightful visualizations, the script aims to provide users with a more comprehensive understanding of the weather patterns.

## Introduction

The script offers the following key features:

1. **Data Import:** The script imports the weather data from a CSV file obtained from the previous project.

2. **Temperature Conversion:** The temperature data is converted from the original unit to Celsius, ensuring uniformity and ease of analysis.

3. **Yearly Trends Visualization:** The script generates a plot depicting the maximum, average, and minimum temperatures over the course of the year.

4. **Monthly Analysis:** The script calculates the average maximum, minimum, and average temperatures for each month. Additionally, it identifies the hottest and coldest day of each month.

5. **Monthly Trends Visualization:** The calculated data is saved to a CSV file, and the script generates a graph showcasing the temperature trends and extremes for each month.
