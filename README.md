# Data Analysis Projects

Welcome to the **Data Analysis Projects** repository, where I showcase my implementations of various data analysis techniques and concepts that I've learned. Each project is designed to demonstrate different aspects of data analysis, including data cleaning, visualization, web scraping, and combinations thereof. Detailed explanations for each project can be found in their respective README files.

## Projects Overview

This repository contains a collection of projects that span different facets of data analysis, including:

- **Data Cleaning:** Projects where I've focused on cleaning and preparing raw data for analysis.

- **Data Visualization:** Projects that involve creating informative and insightful visualizations to present data trends and patterns.

- **Data Scraping:** Implementations that utilize web scraping techniques to gather valuable data from online sources.

- **Combined Analysis:** Projects that combine various data analysis techniques to provide a comprehensive understanding of a dataset.

## Project Structure

Each project within this repository has its own dedicated folder, containing the necessary code, data files, and documentation. The README file in each project folder provides an in-depth explanation of the project's objectives, methodologies, and outcomes.
